				Over the course of the ­half-century war, rural residents have poured into Colombia’s cities to escape bombings, land mines, massacres, kidnappings, death threats and land seizures. They see peace with the FARC — or the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia — as a remedy for one source of violence, but they know that many regions are still threatened by other armed groups. They also don’t trust the government to protect them.
